# CNN for Sports Prediction 🏀🏏🏓🏊

## 📄 Project Overview
This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict the type of sport depicted in an image[cite: 17]. [cite_start]By analyzing visual features, the model classifies images into their respective sports categories with the aim of achieving high accuracy[cite: 18, 22].

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
* Develop a neural network model to accurately predict sport types from images[cite: 22].
* Create a system capability for real-time image classification[cite: 23].
* Implement and train CNN models from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow[cite: 73].
* Leverage pre-trained models for efficient image classification[cite: 74].

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of **3,648 images** divided into three main subsets[cite: 41]:
* **Training:** ~80% (3,366 images) [cite: 42, 49]
* **Validation:** ~10% (140 images) [cite: 44, 48]
* **Testing:** ~10% (142 images) [cite: 46, 50]

### Target Classes
The model is designed to classify images into the following sports [cite: 26-29, 33]:
1.  Basketball
2.  Swimming
3.  Cricket
4.  Table Tennis

## ⚙️ Methodology
* **Task Type:** Multiclass classification, Single label[cite: 37].
* **Techniques:**
    * Image Preprocessing[cite: 52].
    * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)[cite: 72].
    * Regularization Techniques & Optimizers[cite: 54, 55].

## 📊 Results & Evaluation
The model was evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics:
* **Accuracy:** 86% [cite: 61, 62]
* **Loss:** 59% [cite: 63, 64]

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras[cite: 73].
* **Model Type:** CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
