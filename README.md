# CNN for Sports Prediction 🏀🏏🏓🏊

## 📄 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict the type of sport depicted in an image[cite: 17]. [cite_start]By analyzing visual features, the model classifies images into their respective sports categories with the aim of achieving high accuracy[cite: 18, 22].

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
* [cite_start]Develop a neural network model to accurately predict sport types from images[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]Create a system capability for real-time image classification[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]Implement and train CNN models from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow[cite: 73].
* [cite_start]Leverage pre-trained models for efficient image classification[cite: 74].

## 📂 Dataset
[cite_start]The dataset consists of **3,648 images** divided into three main subsets[cite: 41]:
* [cite_start]**Training:** ~80% (3,366 images) [cite: 42, 49]
* [cite_start]**Validation:** ~10% (140 images) [cite: 44, 48]
* [cite_start]**Testing:** ~10% (142 images) [cite: 46, 50]

### Target Classes
[cite_start]The model is designed to classify images into the following sports [cite: 26-29, 33]:
1.  Basketball
2.  Swimming
