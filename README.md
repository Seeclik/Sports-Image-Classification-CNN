A Deep Learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images into 4 sports (Basketball, Swimming, Cricket, Table Tennis) with 86% accuracy using TensorFlow &amp; Keras.

# CNN for Sports Prediction 🏀🏏🏓🏊

## 📄 Project Overview
This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict the type of sport depicted in an image[cite: 17]. [cite_start]By analyzing visual features, the model classifies images into their respective sports categories with the aim of achieving high accuracy.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
* Develop a neural network model to accurately predict sport types from images.
* Create a system capability for real-time image classification.
* Implement and train CNN models from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow.
* Leverage pre-trained models for efficient image classification.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of **3,648 images** divided into three main subsets:
* **Training:** ~80% (3,366 images) 
* **Validation:** ~10% (140 images) 
* **Testing:** ~10% (142 images) 

### Target Classes
The model is designed to classify images into the following sports:
1.  Basketball
2.  Swimming
3.  Cricket
4.  Table Tennis

## ⚙️ Methodology
